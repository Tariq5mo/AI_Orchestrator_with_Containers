Health has a variety of definitions, which have been used for different purposes over time. In general, it refers to physical and emotional well-being. Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, such as regular physical exercise and adequate sleep. Some factors affecting health are due to individual choices. Others are due to structural causes. Still others are beyond both individual and group choices, such as genetic disorders.
